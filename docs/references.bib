abstract="This paper, written as a tribute to Enrico Magenes, a giant that has kindly and warmly supported generations of young researchers, introduces a generalization of the empirical interpolation method (EIM) and the reduced basis method (RBM) in order to allow their combination with data mining and data assimilation. The purpose is to be able to derive sound information from data and reconstruct information, possibly taking into account noise in the acquisition, that can serve as an input to models expressed by partial differential equations. The approach combines data acquisition (with noise) with domain decomposition techniques and reduced basis approximations.",

The essential components of the approach are (i) a good collateral reduced-basis approximation space, (ii) a stable and inexpensive interpolation procedure, and (iii) an effective a posteriori estimator to quantify the newly introduced errors.

Résumé
Nous présentons dans cette Note une méthode rapide de base réduite pour la résolution d'équations aux dérivées partielles ayant une dépendance non affine en ses paramètres. L'approche propose de remplacer le calcul des fonctionelles non affines par un développement en base réduite annexe qui conduit à une évaluation en ligne effectivement affine. Les points essentiels de cette approche sont (i) un bon système de base réduite annexe, (ii) une méthode stable et peu coûteuse d'interpolation dans cette base, et (iii) un estimateur a posteriori pertinent pour quantifier les nouvelles erreurs introduites. Des résultats théoriques et numériques viennent anticiper puis confirmer le bon comportement de cette technique. Pour citer cet article : M. Barrault et al., C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, Ser.

abstract = {Abstract This article presents two extensions of the empirical interpolation method (EIM) designed to deal with vector interpolation problems. These reduced-order modeling techniques are aimed at exploiting pointwise (vector) measurements to obtain the unknown field reconstruction and they are preferred to other, more efficient, techniques as the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) because of their intrinsic capability to identify measurement positions and to perform field reconstruction. The “EIM-roto” method implements rotation matrix coefficients and should be intended as a composition of rotations and dilatations of the vector basis functions. The “EIM-orto” implements diagonal matrices coefficients and can be intended as the interpolation, component by component, of the unknown vector field, projected on a fixed reference system. The two techniques are tested over the lid-driven cavity benchmark, in laminar conditions. The results obtained on this study case highlight how the “EIM-orto” interpolation does not allow a reliable reconstructions, while the “EIM-roto” interpolation allows reconstruction performances close to the POD ones (here used as reference method). In particular, the worst reconstruction error, that is, the maximum L2 − norm of the residuals, decreases exponentially, reaching 5\% with 25 basis functions. This result can be consider satisfactory, considering the nature of the problem.},

abstract = {The Empirical Interpolation Method (EIM), and its generalized version (GEIM), are non-intrusive, reduced-basis model order reduction methods hereby adopted and modified to address the problem of optimal placement of sensors and real-time estimation in thermo-hydraulics systems. These techniques have been used to extract the characteristic spatial modes of the system and select a set of points (or functionals) corresponding to the optimal locations for the sensors. Collecting experimental measurements in the available points allows the construction of an empirical interpolation of the fields employed to estimate the variable of interest. However, when these data are affected by noise, the (G)EIM loses its good convergence properties. In this context, stabilization techniques allow good field reconstruction even with noisy data. This work provides an alternative and effective solution to the problem of reconstructing the system state in the presence of experimental data affected by random noise by using the Tikhonov regularization technique. The developed methods have been tested on a simple thermo-fluid dynamics problem known as “two-sided lid-driven differentially heated square cavity”.}

abstract = {The problem of estimating in real-time the state of a system by combining experimental data and models has been extensively addressed in literature. In particular, there have been a lot of developments in reduced order modelling techniques integrated in a data assimilation framework. This coupling allows to reconstruct the variable of interest considering a priori knowledge (i.e. the mathematical model) and some measurements of it. However, in some engineering systems not all the variables of interest may be measurable and hence the typical framework cannot be applied. However, these methods can be extended to reconstruct the full state of a system, by means of partial observations only. In this work, a novel approach will be introduced, based on a two step method: first the measurements are used to determine the parameters describing the system; then, the full state is estimated by means of reduced order modelling techniques. This new approach will be compared with the state-of-the-art both on a simple thermal hydraulics case and on an innovative nuclear reactor design, the Molten Salt Fast Reactor.}
