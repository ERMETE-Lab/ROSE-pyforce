abstract = {Sensor positioning and real-time estimation of non-observable fields is an open question in the nuclear sector, especially for advanced nuclear reactors. In Circulating Fuel Reactors (CFR), liquid fuel and coolant are homogeneously mixed, and thus these reactors will not have internal structures, making sensor positioning in the primary circuit, including the core, an unresolved problem, making most of the core blind to sensors. Thus, the possibility of estimating the system state in the whole domain using a few local measurements has important implications for safety, monitoring, and control both in nominal and accidental conditions. In this context, the integrated Model Order Reduction and Data Assimilation framework offers intriguing opportunities to reliably combine experimental data and background knowledge from a reduced mathematical model. This work discusses and applies innovative methods within this framework, based on the Generalized Empirical Interpolation and the Indirect Reconstruction algorithms, to a proposed concept of CFR. This work aims to identify the optimal sensor positioning within the core and assess the feasibility of reconstructing the quantities of interest starting only from transient sparse data on fuel temperature, possibly noisy, and testing the predictive capabilities of the discussed methods.}

	abstract = {The Generalized Empirical Interpolation Method (GEIM) is an extension first presented by Maday and Mula in Maday and Mula (2013) in 2013 of the classical empirical interpolation method (presented in 2004 by Barrault, Maday, Nguyen and Patera in Barrault etal. (2004)) where the evaluation at interpolating points is replaced by the more practical evaluation at interpolating continuous linear functionals on a class of Banach spaces. As outlined in Maday and Mula (2013), this allows to relax the continuity constraint in the target functions and expand both the application domain and the stability of the approach. In this paper, we present a thorough analysis of the concept of stability condition of the generalized interpolant (the Lebesgue constant) by relating it to an inf-sup problem in the case of Hilbert spaces. In the second part of the paper, it will be explained how GEIM can be employed to monitor in real time physical experiments by providing an online accurate approximation of the phenomenon that is computed by combining the acquisition of a minimal number, optimally placed, measurements from the processes with their mathematical models (parameter-dependent PDEs). This idea is illustrated through a parameter dependent Stokes problem in which it is shown that the pressure and velocity fields can efficiently be reconstructed with a relatively low-dimensional interpolation space.},

	abstract = {The Empirical Interpolation Method (EIM), and its generalized version (GEIM), are non-intrusive, reduced-basis model order reduction methods hereby adopted and modified to address the problem of optimal placement of sensors and real-time estimation in thermo-hydraulics systems. These techniques have been used to extract the characteristic spatial modes of the system and select a set of points (or functionals) corresponding to the optimal locations for the sensors. Collecting experimental measurements in the available points allows the construction of an empirical interpolation of the fields employed to estimate the variable of interest. However, when these data are affected by noise, the (G)EIM loses its good convergence properties. In this context, stabilization techniques allow good field reconstruction even with noisy data. This work provides an alternative and effective solution to the problem of reconstructing the system state in the presence of experimental data affected by random noise by using the Tikhonov regularization technique. The developed methods have been tested on a simple thermo-fluid dynamics problem known as “two-sided lid-driven differentially heated square cavity”.},

	abstract = {The problem of estimating in real-time the state of a system by combining experimental data and models has been extensively addressed in literature. In particular, there have been a lot of developments in reduced order modelling techniques integrated in a data assimilation framework. This coupling allows to reconstruct the variable of interest considering a priori knowledge (i.e. the mathematical model) and some measurements of it. However, in some engineering systems not all the variables of interest may be measurable and hence the typical framework cannot be applied. However, these methods can be extended to reconstruct the full state of a system, by means of partial observations only. In this work, a novel approach will be introduced, based on a two step method: first the measurements are used to determine the parameters describing the system; then, the full state is estimated by means of reduced order modelling techniques. This new approach will be compared with the state-of-the-art both on a simple thermal hydraulics case and on an innovative nuclear reactor design, the Molten Salt Fast Reactor.},
